The man shakes his head. "Sorry, I don't carry any maps on me."
"...Nope! Feel free to sit if you want."
"Yea. I've just been looking at this really cool wall."

The man gives you a smile. "Nice to meet you too! I'm Justin." 
The man blushes, a dumb expression crossing his face. "I'm, uh, Justin."
"Oh, you want my name..? It's Justin."

Justin thinks really hard. "It's blue- no, Green! ...Actually I think it's yellow."
"I live on campus, actually. I'm in hall four of Dingus."
"I think I'd be a wolf... Or some kind of wolf-lion hybrid mix."
