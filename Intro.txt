Welcome to Romance University! Here at Romance U, the only major is love.
In order to graduate, you have to be in a loving and healthy relationship.
You, however, are stupid and lonely and single.
If you don't want your student loans to go to waste, you need to find yourself a date pronto!

One day, while getting yourself some lunch at the WOO cafe, you see nothing but couples sitting together. All they do is remind you of how lonely you are. On they way to the counter, you notice two people sitting by themselves.
At one table is a totally average looking guy, doing nothing but staring at the wall. 
At the other table is a girl in a business suit, hard at work on her laptop.

Finally! Single people! This is the moment you've been waiting for.

Which person do you choose to approach? (Use 1, 2, and 3 to choose those respective options)
1 - Average guy
2 - Suit girl
3 - Give up and go home
