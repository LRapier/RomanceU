Welcome to Romance U! Here at Romance U, your only option as a major is love.
The only way you can graduate is if you're able to get into a relationship.
You, however, are stupid and lonely and single.
So, if you don't want your student loans to go to waste, you ned to find yourself a date.

One day, while getting yourself some lunch at the WOO cafe, you see nothing but couples sitting together, except for two people.
One is a totally average looking guy, doing nothing. 
The other is a girl in a full suit, hard at work on her laptop.

Which do you choose to approach? (Use 1, 2, and 3 to choose those respective options)
1 - Average guy
2 - Suit girl
3 - Give up and go home
